# What is R?

<li>R is a programming language and environment designed for performing statistical analyses and visualizing data.</li>
<li>R is open source, meaning that users can legally modify and redistribute software.</li>
<li>R is script-based, meaning that text is used to write programs and automate tasks.</li>

# What is RStudio?
<li>RStudio is an integrated development environment which provides a user-friendly interface to work with R.</li>
<li>RStudio streamlines writing scripts and editing code and simplifies managing data and files.</li>
<li>While RStudio is designed primarily for R, it is also compatible with other programming languages such as Python and HTML.</li>
